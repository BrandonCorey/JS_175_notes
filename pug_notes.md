# PUG
## Syntax:
Pug is a template engine that uses indentation to define the structure of your HTML. It also uses special syntax for other HTML elements. For example:
- To create a div element with a **class** of "container", you would write it two ways:
```pug
div.container
```
```pug
div(class="container")
```

- To create an **id** of my_element, you can write it two ways:
```pug
div#myelement
```
```pug
div(id="myelement")
```
- To create a `h1` element with the text "Hell World", you write:
```pug
h1 Hello World
```

- To create a link to stylesheet file, you write:
```pug
link(rel="stylesheet" href="styles/stylesheet.css")
```

Pug code vs what it renders as HTML
```pug
html
  head
    title My Page
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='/styles/style.css')
  body
    h1 Welcome to My Page
    p This is some text on my page.
```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>This is some text on my page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Extending Layouts with Blocks:

Pug allows you to create layout templates that can be extended by other templates. To do this, you create a layout template that includes blocks where content can be inserted by the child templates.
- Default values can be assigned for each block in the layout by nesting an element inside of it (using indentation)
  - These will be used if a matching block is not found in any of the views
```pug
// layout.pug
html
  head
    title My Site
  body
    header
      block headerText
      h1 Website
    main
      block content
    footer
      p Copyright Â© My Site
```
```pug
// english.pug
extends layout

block headerText
  h1 I created this website for practice!

block content
  p Hello, welcome to my website!
```
```spanish.pug
extends layout

block headerText
  h1 Yo hice el sitio web para practicar

block content
  p Hola, bienvenido a mi sitio web
```

## Express and Pug ##
Express is able pass define local variables for a view a few different ways
- `res.render` first argument is view, second argument is optional **object object whose properties/vaues define local variables for the view**
- `app.locals` can also be used to define local variables for the view
  - methods can be defined on `app.locals` called **view helpers**

```javascript
app.get('/english', (req, res) => {
  res.render('hello_world', {currentPath: req.originalUrl});
});
```
```
app.locals.currentPathClass = (path, currentPath) => {
  return path === currentPath ? "current" : "";
};
```
### Local variables in a view
Local view variables can be accessed a few different ways
- Within attributes of elements, variables can be referenced by their names with no additional syntax
  - They can also be refenced using template literal syntax if needed to be interpolated into the middle of a string
- Outside of attributes, they must be used with an `=` sign with the element they are being substituted for
- Either way, the values will be evaluated as a JS expression and then interpolated as a string
```pug
doctype html
  html
    head
      title testing
    body
      img.currentPathClass(./english, currentPath)
```
```pug
doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
  body
    h1= title
    p Welcome to my awesome website!

```
