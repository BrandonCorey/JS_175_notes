- A route can be thought of as a particular combination of HTTP method and URL path, and the application logic that is executed when that combination is matched in order to generate an HTTP response
- The application logic that is executed is commonly referred to as a request handler
- Routes let you use the URL path as an abstraction, rather than as a reference to a specific location within the server file system
- Within a networked application, routing is often handled by a routing engine which abstracts away the complexity of matching routes and executing request handlers
